# Congruence Engine Data Explorer 

## Short summary
One of the key objectives of our work has been to combine the catalogues of objects from a number of historical collections housed across the country. Previous work attempting to use machine-learning techniques has shown that the data in its raw state is often too heterogenous, sparce and distinct from its overall context.  To address this issue this work aims at iteratively developing an app to aid researchers better understand a dataset whilst providing a set of tools to augment, clean and otherwise better contextualise the data to improve performance on downstream tasks; such as clustering.

The app, named The CE Data Explorer, attempts to go beyond what traditional data wrangling tools provide; by providing a suite of tools specifically designed to enable better understand the nature of the data. To do this, a combination of traditional NLP tools, such as Named Entity Recognition, modern data linking methods and visualisation techniques are combined in a single application. The operative power of the Data Explorer is to put the analyst at the centre of the dataset, allowing them to discover new, add or otherwise edit the data, find connections and ultimately further enrich the data (e.g. adding annotations). The aims of this work are three-fold. First, to improve the general quality of the data through the enrichment process. Second, to aid the combination of datasets across disparate sources and writing styles; and third, to produce better contextualised data-points for use in downstream machine-learning tasks; such as clustering and topic-modelling



## Research questions

- Can the results of LLM based research tasks be improved upon by providing a human-in-the-loop strategy for data exploration and manipulation prior to training/classification etc...?

- How can we develop methods for combining datasets using disparate vocabularies and notation?

- Can we add value and information to sparse information vectors through human annotation and edits.
